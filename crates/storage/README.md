# ethrex-storage

Persistent storage layer for the ethrex Ethereum client.

For detailed API documentation, see the rustdocs:
```bash
cargo doc --package ethrex-storage --open
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use ethrex_storage::{Store, EngineType};

// Create with RocksDB backend
let store = Store::new("./data", EngineType::RocksDB)?;

// Add a block
store.add_block(block).await?;

// Query account
let info = store.get_account_info(block_number, address)?;
```

## Features

- `rocksdb`: Enable RocksDB backend for persistent storage (default is in-memory)

## Deep-reorg cap and metrics

By default the maximum reorg depth is physical: how far back the node can reconstruct
state (in-memory layer retention plus the reverse-diff journal's reach). It is bounded
only indirectly by finality, because finality advances prune the journal. To restrict
this further, pass `--max-reorg-depth <N>` on the CLI; reorgs deeper than `N` are
rejected with `-38006 TooDeepReorg`. NOTE: `--max-reorg-depth 0` rejects EVERY reorg,
including routine 1-2 block reorgs — it does not restore the old 128-block cap.

The following Prometheus metrics are exposed under `ethrex_reorg_*` /
`ethrex_deep_reorg_*`:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ethrex_reorg_overlay_entries` | Gauge | Entries in the installed overlay (0 when idle). |
| `ethrex_reorg_overlay_bytes` | Gauge | Byte size of overlay key+value data (0 when idle). |
| `ethrex_reorg_journal_length` | Gauge | Span of the `STATE_HISTORY` column family. |
| `ethrex_reorg_depth` | Histogram | Distribution of attempted reorg depths. |
| `ethrex_reorg_reconcile_duration_seconds` | Histogram | First-commit reconciliation latency. |
| `ethrex_deep_reorg_attempts_total` | Counter | Deep reorgs initiated. |
| `ethrex_deep_reorg_success_total` | Counter | Deep reorgs completed successfully. |
| `ethrex_deep_reorg_aborts_total` | Counter | Deep reorgs that aborted. |

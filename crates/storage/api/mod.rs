//! # Storage Backend API
//!
//! This module provides a thin, minimal interface for storage backends:
//!
//! - Thin: Minimal set of operations that databases must provide
//! - Simple: Avoids type-system complexity and focuses on core functionality
//!
//! Rather than implementing business logic in each database backend, this API
//! provides low-level primitives that higher-level code can build upon.
//! This eliminates code duplication and makes adding new database backends trivial.
//!
//! The API differentiates between three types of database access:
//!
//! - Read views ([`StorageReadView`]): read-only views of the database,
//!   with no atomicity guarantees between operations.
//! - Write batches ([`StorageWriteBatch`]): write batch functionality, with
//!   atomicity guarantees at commit time.
//! - Locked views ([`StorageLockedView`]): read-only views of a point in time (snapshots), right now it's
//!   only used during snap-sync.

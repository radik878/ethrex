//! Native Rollup L2 PoC — parallel L2 mode where blocks are produced and
//! committed via the EXECUTE precompile on L1.
//!
//! This module provides the actors that implement the native rollup L2 lifecycle:
//!
//! - **NativeL1Watcher**: polls L1 for `L1MessageRecorded` events and forwards
//!   them to the block producer via `EnqueueL1Messages` messages
//! - **NativeBlockProducer**: owns the pending-L1-messages queue, drains it to
//!   build relayer txs, and uses the standard payload builder flow to produce blocks
//! - **NativeL1Advancer**: reads produced blocks from the Store, generates an
//!   execution witness, and submits via advance()

//! This module contains the logic for storage range downloads during state sync
//! It works like a queue, waiting for the state sync to advertise newly downloaded accounts with non-empty storages
//! Each storage will be queued and fetch in batches, once a storage is fully fetched it is then advertised to the storage rebuilder
//! Each downloaded storage will be written to the storage snapshot in the DB
//! If the pivot becomes stale while there are still pending storages in queue these will be sent to the storage healer
//! Even if the pivot becomes stale, the fetcher will remain active and listening until a termination signal (an empty batch) is received
//! Potential Improvements: Currenlty, we have a specific method to handle large storage tries (aka storage tries that don't fit into a single storage range request).
//! This method is called while fetching a storage batch and can stall the fetching of other smaller storages.
//! Large storage handling could be moved to its own separate queue process so that it runs parallel to regular storage fetching

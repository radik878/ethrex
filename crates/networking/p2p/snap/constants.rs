// RESPONSE LIMITS
// =============================================================================

///
/// This limits the amount of data a peer can return in a single response,
/// preventing memory exhaustion and ensuring reasonable response times.

/// Maximum number of accounts/items to request in a single snap request.
///
/// This magic number is not part of the protocol specification and is taken
/// from geth. See:
/// <https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/2585776aabbd4ae9b00050403b42afb0cee968ec/eth/downloader/downloader.go#L42-L43>

// =============================================================================
// HASH BOUNDARIES
// =============================================================================

/// Maximum hash value (all bits set to 1).
///
/// Used as the upper bound when requesting the full range of accounts/storage.
pub const HASH_MAX: H256 = H256([0xFF; 32]);

// =============================================================================
// BATCH SIZES
// =============================================================================

/// Size of the in-memory buffer before flushing to disk during snap sync (64 MB).
///
/// During account range and storage range downloads, data is accumulated in memory
/// before being written to temporary files. This constant controls memory usage
/// during the initial snap sync phases.
pub const RANGE_FILE_CHUNK_SIZE: usize = 1024 * 1024 * 64;

/// Number of chunks to split the account range into for parallel downloading.
pub const ACCOUNT_RANGE_CHUNK_COUNT: usize = 800;

/// Number of storage accounts to process per batch during state healing.
pub const STORAGE_BATCH_SIZE: usize = 300;

/// Number of trie nodes to request per batch during state/storage healing.

/// Buffer size for code hash collection before writing.

// =============================================================================
// REQUEST CONFIGURATION
// =============================================================================

/// Timeout for peer responses in snap sync operations.
pub const PEER_REPLY_TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(5);

/// Number of retry attempts when selecting a peer for a request.
pub const PEER_SELECT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: u32 = 3;

/// Number of retry attempts for individual requests.
pub const REQUEST_RETRY_ATTEMPTS: u32 = 5;

/// Maximum number of concurrent in-flight requests during storage healing.
pub const MAX_IN_FLIGHT_REQUESTS: u32 = 77;

/// Soft limit on the number of entries in a healing pending-parents queue.
///
/// Shared by storage healing (`StorageHealingQueue`) and state healing
/// (`StateHealingQueue`). Both are `HashMap`s of nodes awaiting their missing
/// children; both are drained via `commit_node` cascades. The limit is sized
/// for the larger of the two (storage) and is therefore conservative for
/// state.
///
/// Storage per-entry cost, branch-dominated worst case:
/// - `NodeResponse.node`: a branch `Node` is a `Box<BranchNode>` with 16
///   `NodeRef` choices (~56 B each in the `Hash` variant) plus `ValueRLP`
///   header, ≈ 950 B on the heap.
/// - `NodeResponse.node_request`: three `Nibbles` (each a `Vec<u8>`, ~24 B
///   header + up to 64 B data) + one `H256`, ≈ 250 B inline+heap.
/// - `HashMap<(Nibbles, Nibbles), _>` key and bucket overhead, ≈ 100 B.
///
/// Total ≈ 1.3 KB per entry → 800_000 entries ≈ 1.0 GB. State entries omit
/// the extra `acc_path` `Nibbles` and use a single-`Nibbles` key, so they're
/// smaller — the same count uses less memory on that side. Leaf-dominated
/// entries are smaller still, so this is an upper-bound estimate. The limit
/// gates the pending-parents map only; the download queue is a separate
/// (smaller) allocation.
///
/// When exceeded, the dispatcher stops issuing new download requests and
/// waits for in-flight responses to drain the queue. The download queue is a
/// max-heap by depth, so in-flight work is the deepest available — which
/// frees pending parents fastest via `commit_node` cascades.

// BLOCK SYNC CONFIGURATION
// =============================================================================

/// Maximum number of block headers to fetch in a single request.

/// This value is taken from geth. Higher values may cause peer disconnections.

// SNAP SYNC THRESHOLDS

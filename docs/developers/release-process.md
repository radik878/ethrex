# How to Release an ethrex version

Releases are prepared from dedicated release branches and tagged using versioning.

## 1st - Create release branch

Branch name must follow the format `release/vX.Y.Z`.

Examples:

- `release/v1.2.0`
- `release/v3.0.0`
- `release/v3.2.0`

## 2nd - Bump version

The version must be updated to `X.Y.Z` in the release branch. There are multiple `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` files that need to be updated.

First, we need to update the version of the workspace package. You can find it in the `Cargo.toml` file in the root directory, under the `[workspace.package]` section. This is also the version the library crates are published under on crates.io when the release is finalized, so it must be a clean semver version (the `-rc.W` suffix lives only on the git tag).

Then, we need to update five more `Cargo.toml` files that are not part of the workspace but fulfill the role of packages in the monorepo. These are located in the following paths:

- `crates/guest-program/bin/sp1/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/risc0/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/zisk/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/openvm/Cargo.toml`
- `crates/l2/tee/quote-gen/Cargo.toml`

We also need to bump the **internal crate dependency version pins**. ethrex's library crates declare their workspace-internal dependencies with an explicit `version = "X.Y.Z"` (required for publishing to crates.io). These live in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`, plus a few crates that pin a sibling directly (`crates/vm/Cargo.toml`, `crates/blockchain/Cargo.toml`, `crates/l2/sdk/Cargo.toml`). Bump every one of them to the new version, then confirm none were missed — set `PREV` to the version you are bumping **from**:

```bash
PREV=X.Y.Z   # the previous release version
grep -rn "\"$PREV\"" --include=Cargo.toml .   # must return nothing
```

> [!WARNING]
> The version bump must cover **both** `[workspace.package].version` and these dependency pins. If you bump only the workspace version, the release-branch PR still merges cleanly, but the merged result declares every crate at the new version while requiring the **previous** version of its siblings — which breaks the entire workspace build (every `cargo` job fails to resolve).

After updating the version in the `Cargo.toml` files, we need to update the `Cargo.lock` files to reflect the new versions. Run `make update-cargo-lock` from the root directory to update all the `Cargo.lock` files in the repository. You should see changes in at most the following paths:

- In the root directory
- `crates/guest-program/bin/sp1/Cargo.lock`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/risc0/Cargo.lock`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/zisk/Cargo.lock`
- `crates/guest-program/bin/openvm/Cargo.lock`
- `crates/l2/tee/quote-gen/Cargo.lock`
- `crates/vm/levm/bench/revm_comparison/Cargo.lock`
- `tooling/Cargo.lock`

Then, go to the `CLI.md` file located in `docs/` and update the version of the `--builder.extra-data` flag default value to match the new version (for both ethrex and ethrex l2 sections).

Finally, stage and commit the changes to the release branch.

An example of a PR that bumps the version can be found [here](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/pull/4881/files#diff-2e9d962a08321605940b5a657135052fbcef87b5e360662bb527c96d9a615542).

## 3rd - Create & Push Tag

Create a tag with a format `vX.Y.Z-rc.W` where `X.Y.Z` is the semantic version and `W` is a release candidate version. Other names for subversions are also accepted. Example of valid tags:

- `v0.1.3-rc.1`
- `v0.0.2-alpha`

```bash
git tag <release_version>
git push origin <release_version>
```

After pushing the tag, a CI job will compile the binaries for different architectures and create a pre-release with the version specified in the tag name. Along with the binaries, a tar file is uploaded with the contracts and the verification keys. The following binaries are built:

| name | L1 | L2 stack | Provers | CUDA support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ethrex-linux-x86_64 | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| ethrex-linux-aarch64 | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| ethrex-macos-aarch64 | ✅ | ❌ | - | - |
| ethrex-l2-linux-x86_64 | ✅ | ✅ | SP1 - RISC0 - Exec | ❌ |
| ethrex-l2-linux-x86_64-gpu | ✅ | ✅ | SP1 - RISC0 - Exec | ✅ |
| ethrex-l2-linux-aarch64 | ✅ | ✅ | SP1 - Exec | ❌ |
| ethrex-l2-linux-aarch64-gpu| ✅ | ✅ | SP1 - Exec | ✅ |
| ethrex-l2-macos-aarch64 | ✅ | ✅ | Exec | ❌ |

Also, two docker images are built and pushed to the Github Container registry:
- `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-rc.W`
- `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-rc.W-l2`

A changelog will be generated based on commit names (using conventional commits) from the last stable tag.

## 4th - Test & Publish Release

### Testing checklist

Before publishing the release, run through the following checks using the pre-release binaries:

- [ ] Upgrade `ethrex-ethdocker-mainnet`
- [ ] Upgrade `ethrex-mainnet-1`
- [ ] Upgrade `ethrex-prysm`
- [ ] Upgrade `ethrex-teku`
- [ ] Upgrade `ethrex-grandine`
- [ ] Launch multisync on `ethrex-multisync-main`
- [ ] Upgrade a local L2 created with the previous version and run the integration tests
- [ ] Run the L2 integration tests with a SP1 prover on the GPU server (`l2-gpu`)

The commands for each target follow. The host roster changes between releases — fill in the ones you run and leave the placeholders for the rest. Replace `vX.Y.Z-rc.W` / `release/vX.Y.Z` with the version under test.

#### `ethrex-ethdocker-mainnet`

```bash
ssh admin@ethrex-ethdocker-mainnet
cd eth-docker/
# In .env, set the release tag on this line:
#   ETHREX_SRC_BUILD_TARGET=vX.Y.Z-rc.W
nano .env
./ethd update
./ethd up
```

#### `ethrex-mainnet-1`

<!-- TODO: document the upgrade procedure for this host -->

#### `ethrex-prysm`, `ethrex-teku`, `ethrex-grandine`

These are ethrex mainnet nodes paired with different consensus clients (Prysm, Teku, Grandine); the ethrex (EL) upgrade procedure is the same across them.

They run the ethrex binary downloaded from the release in a tmux session, the consensus also runs in its own tmux session.

```bash
tmux ls
# gracefully stop ethrex
tmux a -t ethrex
# ctrl-c
exit

wget -q -O ethrex-linux-x86_64 \
  https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/releases/download/v20.0.0-rc.1/ethrex-linux-x86_64
chmod +x ethrex-linux-x86_64

./ethrex-linux-x86_64 --version # ethrex/v20.0.0-

tmux new-session -d -s ethrex \
  'cd ~ && RUST_LOG=info ./ethrex-linux-x86_64 \
     --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --http.api eth,net,web3,admin \
     --metrics --metrics.port 3701 \
     --network mainnet \
     --authrpc.jwtsecret /home/admin/secrets/jwt.hex 2>&1 | tee -a ~/ethrex-rc.log'
```

#### `ethrex-multisync-main`

```bash
ssh admin@ethrex-multisync-main
cd ethrex/tooling/sync/
tmux kill-session -t sync 2>/dev/null || true   # drop a leftover sync session from a previous RC
tmux new-session -d -s sync "make multisync-loop-auto MULTISYNC_BRANCH=release/vX.Y.Z 2>&1"
```

Check progress later with `tmux attach -t sync` (detach with `Ctrl-b` then `d`).

#### Local L2 upgrade + integration tests

See [Upgrade test](l2/upgrade-test.md) for the full procedure.

#### L2 integration tests with a SP1 prover (`l2-gpu`)

See [L2 integration tests with a SP1 GPU prover](l2/sp1-gpu-integration-test.md) for the full procedure.

### Publish

Once the pre-release is created and you want to publish the release, go to the [release page](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/releases) and follow the next steps:

1. Click on the edit button of the last pre-release created

    ![edit button](../img/publish_release_step_1.png)

2. Manually create the tag `vX.Y.Z`. **Set the tag's _Target_ to the release branch (`release/vX.Y.Z`), not the default `main`** — otherwise the tag lands on `main`'s HEAD, which is not the version-bumped commit.

    ![edit tag](../img/publish_release_step_2.png)

    The tag is created on the remote only once you click *Update release* (step 5) — so verify it **after** saving (an earlier `ls-remote` returns nothing for `vX.Y.Z` and falsely "matches" two empty results). The two SHAs must be identical:

    ```bash
    git ls-remote origin refs/tags/vX.Y.Z refs/tags/vX.Y.Z-rc.W   # run after Update release; SHAs must match
    ```

    If they don't match, move the tag to the tested commit before relying on any published artifacts: `git tag -f vX.Y.Z <rc-commit> && git push origin vX.Y.Z --force`.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The crates.io publish workflow reads `publish.yml` from `main` but checks out the **tag's commit**. If the tag points at the wrong commit (e.g. an unbumped `main`), the workflow republishes the *previous* version's crates — each is "already published", so the run goes **green while publishing nothing new**. The final `vX.Y.Z` tag must point at the same commit as the tested `vX.Y.Z-rc.W` (the release branch HEAD you will merge via PR).

3. Update the release title

    ![edit title](../img/publish_release_step_3.png)

4. Customize the release notes.

    The auto-generated changelog lists every commit, but it doesn't tell operators what actually matters in this release. Above the auto-generated changelog, add a hand-written summary using [GitHub alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts). Pick boxes by what the operator needs to decide, in this order:

    - `> [!IMPORTANT]` — **only** when the release carries critical security or correctness fixes. One line stating that upgrading is strongly recommended for all operators.
    - `> [!WARNING]` — **only** when the upgrade can't be cleanly undone or carries a breaking change the operator must account for: a database schema migration you can't roll back from, a required resync, removed or renamed CLI flags / config options, changed defaults, breaking RPC/API changes, or new minimum requirements (disk, dependency, consensus-client version). State what changes and what the operator must do.
    - `> [!NOTE]` — **always**. A **What's new** list of the highlights (new features, important fixes), plus a line saying whether a resync is needed (if not already covered above).

    Keep the space after `>` (`> [!NOTE]`, not `>[!NOTE]`) and leave a blank line between boxes so each renders separately. Drop the `[!IMPORTANT]` / `[!WARNING]` boxes when they don't apply — a routine release needs only the `[!NOTE]`.

    ```markdown
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This release contains critical fixes. Upgrading is strongly recommended for all operators.

    > [!WARNING]
    > This release changes the database schema; once you upgrade you can't roll back to a previous version. The migration runs automatically.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **What's new**
    > - <highlight>
    > - <highlight>
    >
    > No resync is needed.
    ```

5. Set the release as the latest release (you will need to uncheck the pre-release first). And finally, click on `Update release`

    ![set latest release](../img/publish_release_step_4.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do the tag rename (`vX.Y.Z-rc.W` → `vX.Y.Z`) **and** unchecking *pre-release* in a **single** `Update release` edit. The automatic promotion fires on that one edit because it both renames the tag and clears the pre-release flag; splitting it across two saves means neither edit carries both signals and the `latest` tag is not moved. If that happens, use the manual recovery in [Troubleshooting](#failure-on-latest-release-workflow).

Once done, the `Ethrex Latest Release` workflow (triggered by that edit) will publish new tags for the already compiled docker images:

- `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z`, `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:latest`
- `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-l2`, `ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:l2`

Promoting the pre-release to a full release also publishes ethrex's library crates to crates.io — see the next section.

### Publishing to crates.io

Promoting the pre-release to a full release (the `released` event from the step above) triggers the `publish.yml` workflow, which runs `cargo publish` for ethrex's publishable library crates in dependency order, at the workspace version `X.Y.Z`.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the **final** release publishes to crates.io. Pre-release (`vX.Y.Z-rc.W`) tags do **not**: the `released` event does not fire for pre-releases, and crates.io versions are immutable, so a release candidate must never claim the version before it has been tested.

The crates are published at the `[workspace.package].version` bumped in step 2; the `-rc.W` suffix lives only on the git tag and never reaches crates.io.

This requires a one-time organizational setup before the first release that publishes:

- A `CRATES_IO_TOKEN` repository secret with publish rights for the crates.
- A `crates-release-prod` GitHub environment (the workflow runs inside it).
- crates.io ownership of the crate names (the first publish under the token claims them).

The workflow is idempotent: a crate version already on crates.io is skipped, so re-running after a partial failure is safe. To validate without publishing, run it manually from the Actions tab (the `workflow_dispatch` trigger) with the dry-run input checked — it lists each crate's package contents instead of publishing.

## 5th - Release the rex counterpart

Every ethrex release has a matching [rex](https://github.com/lambdaclass/rex) release with the same `X.Y.Z` version. Once the ethrex release is fully promoted, release the counterpart:

1. In `lambdaclass/rex`, bump every `ethrex-*` dependency pin in `Cargo.toml` to `X.Y.Z` and refresh the lockfile ([example bump](https://github.com/lambdaclass/rex/commit/84099c31)). This step must come **after** the promotion: the pins resolve against crates.io, so the ethrex crates have to be published first.
2. Create and push a `vX.Y.Z-rc.W` tag. The `Rex Release` workflow builds the binaries and creates a pre-release, mirroring ethrex's flow.
3. Verify the pre-release, then promote it to `vX.Y.Z` the same way as the ethrex release: rename the tag on the tested commit and untick *pre-release* in a single *Update release* edit.

## 6th - Update Homebrew

Disclaimer: We should automate this

Set the released version once, then the commands below are copy/paste:

```bash
export V=X.Y.Z   # replace with the released version, no `v` prefix (e.g. 3.0.0)
```

1. Commit a change in https://github.com/lambdaclass/homebrew-tap/ bumping the ethrex version (like [this one](https://github.com/lambdaclass/homebrew-tap/commit/d78a2772ad9c5412e7f84c6210bd85c970fcd0e6)). It needs two SHA-256 hashes:

    - **Source tarball hash** (the `url` field) — download the GitHub source archive and hash it:

        ```bash
        curl -L -o "ethrex-v$V.tar.gz" "https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/archive/refs/tags/v$V.tar.gz"
        shasum -a 256 "ethrex-v$V.tar.gz"
        ```

    - **Bottle hash** (the `bottle` section) — build the macOS bottle from the release binary. The `ethrex` directory is the bottle root:

        ```bash
        # download the L2 macOS binary from the ethrex release
        gh release download "v$V" -R lambdaclass/ethrex -p ethrex-l2-macos-aarch64
        chmod +x ethrex-l2-macos-aarch64

        # lay it out as ethrex/<version>/bin/ethrex (last `ethrex` is the binary)
        mkdir -p "ethrex/$V/bin"
        mv ethrex-l2-macos-aarch64 "ethrex/$V/bin/ethrex"

        # strip quarantine flags (root dir is ./ethrex)
        xattr -dr com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms ethrex
        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ethrex

        # tar and hash the bottle (root dir is ./ethrex)
        tar -czf "ethrex-$V.arm64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz" ethrex
        shasum -a 256 "ethrex-$V.arm64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz"
        ```

2. Push the commit.
3. Create a new release with tag `v$V` in homebrew-tap. **IMPORTANT**: attach the `ethrex-$V.arm64_sonoma.bottle.tar.gz` to the release.

## 7th - Merge the release branch via PR

Once the release is verified, **merge the branch via PR**.

## Dealing with hotfixes

If hotfixes are needed before the final release, commit them to `release/vX.Y.Z`, push, and create a new pre-release tag. The final tag `vX.Y.Z` should always point to the exact commit you will merge via PR.

## Troubleshooting

### Failure on "latest release" workflow

If the `latest` / `l2` Docker tags don't get updated after step 5 (the `Ethrex Latest Release` run skipped the retag, or its `assert-latest-promoted` job failed), recover with the workflow's manual path — no local Docker or PAT needed:

- Go to **Actions → Ethrex Latest Release → Run workflow**.
- Set `rc_tag` to the tested release candidate (e.g. `v18.0.0-rc.1`) and `version` to the final version (e.g. `v18.0.0`).
- Run it. The run retags `latest` / `l2` / `performance` / `X.Y.Z` from the RC image, publishes the apt package, and the `verify-latest` job confirms `:latest` resolves to `:X.Y.Z` (the run goes red if it doesn't).

If the registry itself is unreachable through Actions and you must promote by hand, do it **server-side** so the multi-arch image index is preserved. (A `docker pull --platform linux/amd64 … && docker tag && docker push` collapses `:latest` to a single architecture, silently dropping arm64.)

- Create a new Github Personal Access Token (PAT) from the [settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).
- Check `write:packages` permission (this will auto-check `repo` permissions too), give a name and a short expiration time.
- Save the token securely.
- Click on `Configure SSO` button and authorize LambdaClass organization.
- Log in to Github Container Registry: `docker login ghcr.io`. Put your Github's username and use the token as your password.
- Retag the RC images to the release tags (server-side, multi-arch index preserved — same operation the workflow performs):

```bash
docker buildx imagetools create \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:latest \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:performance \
  ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-rc.W
docker buildx imagetools create \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-l2 \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:l2 \
  -t ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:performance-l2 \
  ghcr.io/lambdaclass/ethrex:X.Y.Z-rc.W-l2
```

- Delete the PAT for security ([here](https://github.com/settings/tokens))

### Failure on the crates.io publish workflow

If `publish.yml` fails partway through, fix the cause and re-run the workflow. Crates already published at the release version are skipped (the run tolerates an "already exists" error), so it resumes from the first crate that has not been published yet. Because crates are published in dependency order, a metadata or ordering error in one crate blocks the crates that depend on it, while the ones published before it stay published (crates.io versions cannot be unpublished or overwritten — a fix requires a new version).

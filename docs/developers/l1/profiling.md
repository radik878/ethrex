# Profiling

This guide covers the profiling tools available for ethrex developers, including CPU profiling and memory profiling.

## CPU Profiling with `pprof`

Ethrex includes built-in CPU profiling via [pprof-rs](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs), gated behind the `cpu_profiling` feature flag. When enabled, a profiler starts at boot (1000 Hz sampling) and writes a `profile.pb` file to the current working directory at shutdown.

### Prerequisites

To view the generated profiles you need one of:

- **Go toolchain** (`go tool pprof`) — the standard pprof viewer
- **pprof CLI** — standalone binary from [google/pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof)

Install the standalone CLI:

```bash
go install github.com/google/pprof@latest
```

### Building with CPU profiling

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build -p ethrex --features cpu_profiling

# Release build (recommended for realistic profiles)
cargo build -p ethrex --release --features cpu_profiling
```

The `cpu_profiling` feature is opt-in (not in `default`) so normal builds are unaffected.

### Collecting a profile

1. Start the node as usual:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/ethrex --authrpc.jwtsecret ./secrets/jwt.hex --network hoodi
   ```

   You should see this log line near startup:

   ```
   CPU profiling enabled (1000 Hz), will write profile.pb at shutdown
   ```

2. Let the node run through the workload you want to profile.

3. Stop the node with `Ctrl+C` or `SIGTERM`. The file `profile.pb` will be written to the current working directory and the shutdown logs will include:

   ```
   CPU profile written to profile.pb
   ```

### Analyzing the profile

#### Interactive web UI

```bash
go tool pprof -http=:8080 profile.pb
```

This opens a browser with flame graphs, call graphs, top functions, and source annotations.

#### Terminal top functions

```bash
go tool pprof profile.pb
# then at the (pprof) prompt:
(pprof) top 20
(pprof) top 20 -cum
```

#### Flame graph (SVG)

```bash
go tool pprof -svg profile.pb > flamegraph.svg
```

#### Focus on a specific function

```bash
go tool pprof -http=:8080 -focus=execute_block profile.pb
```

### Tips

- **Use release builds** for profiling. Debug builds have very different performance characteristics due to missing optimizations and extra debug assertions.
- **Profile with `release-with-debug`** if you want accurate profiles with full symbol names. This gives optimized code with debug symbols:
  ```bash
  cargo build -p ethrex --profile release-with-debug --features cpu_profiling
  ```
- **Combine with jemalloc** — the `cpu_profiling` feature is orthogonal to `jemalloc` and `jemalloc_profiling`. You can enable both:
  ```bash
  cargo build -p ethrex --release --features cpu_profiling,jemalloc
  ```
- **Sampling rate** — the profiler samples at 1000 Hz (once per millisecond). This is high enough to get good resolution without significant overhead.
- **File location** — `profile.pb` is written to whichever directory you run the binary from. If you want it elsewhere, `cd` to that directory before starting the node, or move the file after shutdown.

## Memory Profiling with jemalloc

Ethrex supports memory profiling through jemalloc, gated behind the `jemalloc_profiling` feature flag. This enables jemalloc's built-in heap profiling (`prof:true`) and exposes `/debug/pprof/allocs` and `/debug/pprof/allocs/flamegraph` RPC endpoints for on-demand heap dumps.

### Building with memory profiling

```bash
cargo build -p ethrex --release --features jemalloc_profiling
```

> **Note:** `jemalloc_profiling` implies the `jemalloc` feature, so you don't need to specify both.

### External memory profilers

You can also use external tools with the `jemalloc` feature (without `jemalloc_profiling`):

#### Bytehound

Requires [Bytehound](https://github.com/koute/bytehound) and jemalloc installed on the system.

```bash
cargo build -p ethrex --release --features jemalloc

export MEMORY_PROFILER_LOG=warn
LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libbytehound.so:/path/to/libjemalloc.so ./target/release/ethrex [ARGS]
```

#### Heaptrack (Linux only)

Requires [Heaptrack](https://github.com/KDE/heaptrack) and jemalloc installed on the system.

```bash
cargo build -p ethrex --release --features jemalloc

LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libjemalloc.so heaptrack ./target/release/ethrex [ARGS]
heaptrack_print heaptrack.ethrex.<pid>.gz > heaptrack.stacks
```

## Profiling with Samply

[Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply) is a sampling CPU profiler that works on macOS and Linux and produces profiles viewable in the Firefox Profiler.

```bash
cargo build -p ethrex --profile release-with-debug
samply record ./target/release-with-debug/ethrex [ARGS]
```

This will open the Firefox Profiler UI in your browser when the process exits.

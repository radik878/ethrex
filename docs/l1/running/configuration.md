# Configuration

This page covers the basic configuration options for running an L1 node with ethrex. Full list of options can be found at the [CLI reference](../../CLI.md)

## Sync Modes

Ethrex supports different sync modes for node operation:

- **snap** (default): Fast sync using state snapshots (recommended for most users).
- **full**: Downloads and verifies the entire chain.

Set the sync mode with:

```sh
ethrex --syncmode <mode>
```

## File Locations

By default, ethrex stores its data in:

- Linux: `~/.local/share/ethrex`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ethrex`

You can change the data directory with:

```sh
ethrex --datadir <path>
```

## Ports

Default ports used by ethrex:

- `8545`: JSON-RPC (HTTP)
- `8551`: Auth JSON-RPC
- `30303`: P2P networking (TCP/UDP)
- `9090`: Metrics

You can change ports with the corresponding flags: `--http.port`, `--authrpc.port`, `--p2p.port`, `--discovery.port`, `--metrics.port`.

The HTTP JSON-RPC and Auth RPC servers listen on `127.0.0.1` by default so a fresh install on a public host is not exposed to the open internet. P2P networking and metrics listen on `0.0.0.0`. Use the corresponding `--http.addr`, `--authrpc.addr`, `--metrics.addr` flags to override.

The HTTP RPC also restricts which JSON-RPC namespaces it serves. By default only `eth`, `net`, and `web3` are reachable; enable `admin`, `debug`, or `txpool` explicitly with `--http.api`, for example:

```sh
ethrex --http.api eth,net,web3,debug
```

`--http.api` is independent of `--http.addr`: it controls which methods are served on the port, not who can reach it. If you also need remote callers to reach the RPC port, pass `--http.addr 0.0.0.0` — only do so when the node sits behind a trusted firewall or reverse proxy, since the `admin_*`, `debug_*`, and `txpool_*` namespaces are unauthenticated.

## Log Levels

Control log verbosity with:

```sh
ethrex --log.level <level>
```

Levels: `error`, `warn`, `info` (default), `debug`, `trace`

## Dev Mode (Localnet)

For local development and testing, you can use dev mode:

```sh
ethrex --dev
```

This runs a local network with block production and no external peers. This network has a list of [predefined accounts](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex/blob/main/fixtures/keys/private_keys_l1.txt) with funds for testing purposes.

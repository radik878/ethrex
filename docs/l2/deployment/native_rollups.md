# Deploying a native rollups ethrex L2

This guide covers how to deploy a native rollup L2 using ethrex. Native rollups (based on [EIP-8079](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8079)) replace ZK proofs and fraud proofs with direct re-execution on L1: when the L2 submits a block, L1 re-executes it via the `EXECUTE` precompile and verifies the state transition is correct.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a proof-of-concept. The native rollup L2 runs against a local ethrex L1 with the EXECUTE precompile enabled. It is not yet intended for public testnets or production.

```

The three L2 GenServer actors run as concurrent tasks:

- **NativeL1Watcher** — Polls the L1 NativeRollup.sol contract at regular intervals for `L1MessageRecorded` events and forwards them to the NativeBlockProducer via `EnqueueL1Messages` actor messages (there is no shared queue; the producer owns a private message queue). It scans L1 logs in configurable block ranges and parses the event data (sender, recipient, value, gas limit, calldata, nonce).

- **NativeBlockProducer** — Produces L2 blocks every `block_time_ms` milliseconds. It first consumes pending L1 messages from its own queue, builds signed relayer transactions to execute those messages via the L2Bridge contract, then fills remaining block gas with regular mempool transactions. It sets `parent_beacon_block_root` in the block header to the L1 messages Merkle root, which the EIP-4788 system contract stores at `BEACON_ROOTS_ADDRESS` during block processing.

- **NativeL1Advancer** — Reads produced L2 blocks from the Store, generates an execution witness, encodes it as SSZ `StatelessInput`, and submits it to NativeRollup.sol via `advance()`. The contract forwards the SSZ to the EXECUTE precompile which calls `verify_stateless_new_payload`.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (stable)
- `solc` (Solidity compiler) — needed to compile the contracts during build
- [`rex`](https://github.com/lambdaclass/rex/tree/feat/claim-native-withdraw) — run `make cli` in that branch to install the required version
- Docker — needed for the Blockscout block explorer (Step 6)
- Python 3 — needed for the contract verification script (Step 6)

> [!NOTE]
> **Rex CLI syntax quirks:**
> - `--value` is always in **wei** (e.g., `1000000000000000000` for 1 ETH).
> - `bytes` arguments should be passed as hex **without** the `0x` prefix (e.g., `d09de08a`), or as `""` for empty bytes.

Verify solc is installed:

```shell
solc --version
```

## Demo

> **What this demo shows:** a native rollup L2 that settles blocks to L1 via direct re-execution (the EXECUTE precompile), with a live deposit (L1→L2) and withdrawal (L2→L1) roundtrip.

The native rollup L2 runs with two terminals: one for L1, one for L2. A third terminal is used for deploying, querying, and interacting.

All commands are run from the repository root.

### Setup

Build the binary first (this compiles the Solidity contracts and embeds them):

```shell
COMPILE_CONTRACTS=true cargo build --release --features l2,l2-sql
```

Clean up any previous state:

```shell
rm -rf /tmp/ethrex_l1 /tmp/ethrex_l2
```

#### Terminal 1 — Start L1

Start a local ethrex L1 with the EXECUTE precompile enabled. This uses a
dedicated genesis (`l1_native.json`) that activates the LStar fork, which is
what turns address `0x0101` into the `EXECUTE` precompile:

```shell
./target/release/ethrex \
  --network fixtures/genesis/l1_native.json \
  --http.port 8545 --http.addr 0.0.0.0 --authrpc.port 8551 \
  --dev --datadir /tmp/ethrex_l1
```

Wait until you see L1 producing blocks (the `--dev` flag auto-mines).

#### Terminal 2 — Deploy contracts and start L2

Deploy `NativeRollup.sol` to L1 and generate the L2 genesis:

```shell
./target/release/ethrex l2 deploy \
  --eth-rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --private-key 0x385c546456b6a603a1cfcaa9ec9494ba4832da08dd6bcf4de9a71e4a01b74924 \
  --native-rollups \
  --native-rollups.relayer-pk 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d \
  --native-rollups.finality-delay 0 \
  --l2-gas-limit 15000000 \
  --genesis-l2-path fixtures/genesis/native_l2.json
```

> **`--l2-gas-limit`**: `advance()` re-executes the whole L2 block inside a single
> L1 transaction, so this value must stay under the L1 per-transaction gas cap
> (EIP-7825, 16,777,216) with headroom for the precompile's witness/bookkeeping
> gas. `15000000` is the tested value; the deployer rejects anything above the cap
> and the immutable contract enforces the same bound in its constructor.
>
> **`--native-rollups.finality-delay 0`**: instant finality, **local demo only**.
> The value is baked immutably into the contract, has no default, and a production
> deployment must pass a reorg-safe delay in seconds.

You should see output like:

```
NativeRollup.sol deployed at: 0x...
Contract address written to cmd/.env
```

Load the contract address and start the L2 node:

```shell
source cmd/.env

./target/release/ethrex l2 \
  --native-rollups \
  --native-rollups.contract-address $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  --native-rollups.relayer-pk 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d \
  --native-rollups.l1-pk 0x385c546456b6a603a1cfcaa9ec9494ba4832da08dd6bcf4de9a71e4a01b74924 \
  --network fixtures/genesis/native_l2.json \
  --http.port 1729 --http.addr 0.0.0.0 \
  --datadir /tmp/ethrex_l2 \
  --eth.rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  --no-monitor
```

### Step 1: Verify the L2 is advancing

Once the L2 is running, you should see log lines like:

```
NativeBlockProducer: produced block N (0x...) with M txs, gas_used=X
NativeL1Advancer: advanced block N on L1 (state_root=0x..., l1_msgs=0, tx=Some(0x...))
```

Query the L1 contract to verify:

```shell
source cmd/.env

# L2 block number committed to L1
rex call $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "blockNumber()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# L2 block number from the L2 RPC directly
rex block-number --rpc-url http://localhost:1729
```

The L1 value should trail the L2 value by a few blocks (the advancer runs on a configurable interval).

### Step 2: Query contract state

The `NativeRollup.sol` contract exposes public getters for all its state:

```shell
# Current L2 state root
rex call $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "stateRoot()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Current L2 block hash
rex call $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "blockHash()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Block gas limit
rex call $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "l2GasLimit()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Chain ID
rex call $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "chainId()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

### Step 3: Deposit ETH (L1 → L2)

Send ETH from L1 to a fresh account on L2.

```shell
# Pick a fresh address (not pre-funded on L2)
# Private key 0x42 → address 0x6f4c950442e1af093bcff730381e63ae9171b87a
DEPOSIT_TO=0x6f4c950442e1af093bcff730381e63ae9171b87a

# Check L2 balance is 0
rex balance $DEPOSIT_TO --rpc-url http://localhost:1729

# Deposit 1 ETH via sendL1Message(to, gasLimit, data)
# Note: --value is in wei (1 ETH = 1000000000000000000)
rex send $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "sendL1Message(address,uint256,bytes)" \
  $DEPOSIT_TO 105000 "" \
  --value 1000000000000000000 \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  -k 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31

# Watch the L2 logs in Terminal 2 — the watcher picks up the message and
# the block producer includes a relayer tx for it.

# After ~10 seconds, check the L2 balance:
rex balance $DEPOSIT_TO --rpc-url http://localhost:1729
# Should show 1000000000000000000 (1 ETH in wei)
```

### Step 4: Deploy a contract on L2 and call it from L1

This step demonstrates that L1→L2 messages can carry arbitrary calldata, not just ETH transfers. We deploy a Counter contract on L2, then increment it by sending a message from L1.

```shell
# Deploy Counter.sol on L2 (increment + get functions)
# Uses the deposit recipient account (funded with 1 ETH in Step 3)
rex deploy --contract-path crates/l2/contracts/src/example/Counter.sol \
  --remappings "" \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:1729 \
  --private-key 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042
# Note the deployed contract address from the output
COUNTER=<deployed_address>

# Verify counter starts at 0
rex call $COUNTER "count()" --rpc-url http://localhost:1729

# Send an L1 message that calls increment() on the counter
# increment() selector = 0xd09de08a (pass without 0x prefix as bytes arg)
rex send $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  "sendL1Message(address,uint256,bytes)" \
  $COUNTER 105000 d09de08a \
  --value 0 \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 \
  -k 0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31

# Wait ~10 seconds for the L2 to process the L1 message, then check:
rex call $COUNTER "count()" --rpc-url http://localhost:1729
# Should return 1
```

### Step 5: Withdraw ETH (L2 → L1)

Send ETH from L2 back to an L1 address.

```shell
# L1 receiver address (the deployer account)
L1_RECEIVER=0xE25583099BA105D9ec0A67f5Ae86D90e50036425

# Record L1 balance before
rex balance $L1_RECEIVER --rpc-url http://localhost:8545

# Withdraw 0.5 ETH from L2 via L2Bridge.withdraw(receiver)
# Uses the test account's private key (0x42)
rex send 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000fffd \
  "withdraw(address)" \
  $L1_RECEIVER \
  --value 500000000000000000 \
  --rpc-url http://localhost:1729 \
  -k 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000042
```

Wait for the L2 block containing the withdrawal to be advanced on L1 (watch the advancer logs in Terminal 2).

Then claim the withdrawal on L1 (replace `TX_HASH` with the L2 withdrawal tx hash from the output above):

```shell
# Fetches the proof from L2 and claims the withdrawal on L1 in one step
rex l2 claim-native-withdraw TX_HASH \
  0xbcdf20249abf0ed6d944c0288fad489e33f66b3960d9e6229c1cd214ed3bbe31 \
  $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
  http://localhost:8545 \
  http://localhost:1729

# Verify the L1 balance increased
rex balance $L1_RECEIVER --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

> [!TIP]
> The integration test at `test/tests/l2/native_rollup.rs` automates the full deposit/withdraw/counter roundtrip including proof fetching and claim submission. Run it with:
> ```shell
> cargo test -p ethrex-test --features l2 -- l2::native_rollup --nocapture
> ```

### Step 6: Verify precompile usage with Blockscout

Run a [Blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout) block explorer against the L1 to visually confirm that each `advance()` transaction triggers an internal CALL to the EXECUTE precompile at `0x0000...0101`.

Requires Docker and a local clone of [Blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout).

#### Set up Blockscout

Clone Blockscout and enable the smart contract verifier (needed to decode method names):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout.git ~/Documents/blockscout
cd ~/Documents/blockscout/docker-compose
```

Add the `smart-contract-verifier` service to `geth.yml` (after the `sig-provider` service):

```yaml
  smart-contract-verifier:
    extends:
      file: ./services/smart-contract-verifier.yml
      service: smart-contract-verifier
```

Enable it in `envs/common-blockscout.env` — find the commented-out verifier lines and replace them with:

```
MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_ENABLED=true
MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_URL=http://smart-contract-verifier:8050/
MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_TYPE=sc_verifier
```

#### Start Blockscout

With L1 and L2 already running:

```shell
cd ~/Documents/blockscout/docker-compose
docker compose -f geth.yml up -d
```

Wait for Blockscout to finish indexing before proceeding. The more blocks L1 has already mined, the longer this takes (typically 1-2 minutes). You can check progress at http://localhost or via the API:

```shell
curl -s 'http://localhost/api/v2/main-page/indexing-status' | python3 -m json.tool
# Wait until "finished_indexing_blocks": true and "indexed_blocks_ratio": "1.00"
```

Then open http://localhost.

#### Verify the NativeRollup contract

Verifying the contract in Blockscout lets it decode function selectors (like `0x069c7eee`) into human-readable method names (like `advance`). This uses Blockscout's built-in verification API — it's completely local and free.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The contract must be fully indexed before verification works. If the script fails with `Address is not a smart-contract`, wait another 30 seconds and retry — Blockscout is still processing.

From the ethrex repo root, run:

```shell
python3 tooling/l2/dev/blockscout_verify_native_rollup.py $ETHREX_NATIVE_ROLLUP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

You should see `Contract verified successfully!`. Now Blockscout will show decoded method names, event names, and parameter values for all interactions with the contract.

#### What to look for

On the homepage you should see `advance` transactions from the advancer to the NativeRollup contract. Click any of them and check:

- **Internal txns** tab: shows `Call | Success | 0xC5...7600 → 0x00...0101` — the NativeRollup contract calling the EXECUTE precompile.
- **Logs** tab: shows the `StateAdvanced` event with the new L2 block number and state root.

#### Stop Blockscout

```shell
cd ~/Documents/blockscout/docker-compose
docker compose -f geth.yml down -v
rm -rf services/blockscout-db-data services/stats-db-data
```

### Cleaning up

Remove the databases to start fresh:

```shell
rm -rf /tmp/ethrex_l1 /tmp/ethrex_l2
```

# Running Ethrex in Aligned Mode

This document explains how to run an Ethrex L2 node in **Aligned mode** and highlights the key differences in component behavior compared to the default mode.

- Check [How to Run (local devnet)](#how-to-run-local-devnet) for a development or testing.
- Check [How to Run (testnet)](#how-to-run-testnet) for a prod-like environment.

## How to run (testnet)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For this guide we assumed that there is an L1 running with all Aligned environment set.

### 1. Generate the prover ELF/VK

Run:

```bash
cd ethrex/crates/l2
make build-prover-<sp1/risc0> # optional: GPU=true
```

This will generate the SP1 ELF program and verification key under:

- `crates/l2/prover/src/guest_program/src/sp1/out/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-elf`
- `crates/l2/prover/src/guest_program/src/sp1/out/riscv32im-succinct-zkvm-vk`

### 2. Deploying L1 Contracts

In a console with `ethrex/crates/l2` as the current directory, run the following command:

```bash
COMPILE_CONTRACTS=true \
ETHREX_L2_ALIGNED=true \
ETHREX_DEPLOYER_ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS=<ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS> \
ETHREX_L2_SP1=true \
ETHREX_DEPLOYER_RANDOMIZE_CONTRACT_DEPLOYMENT=true \
cargo run --release --features l2,l2-sql --manifest-path "../../Cargo.toml" -- l2 deploy \
        --eth-rpc-url <ETH_RPC_URL> \
        --private-key <YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY> \
        --on-chain-proposer-owner <ON_CHAIN_PROPOSER_OWNER>  \
        --bridge-owner <BRIDGE_OWNER_ADDRESS>  \
        --genesis-l2-path "../../fixtures/genesis/l2.json" \
        --proof-sender.l1-address <PROOF_SENDER_L1_ADDRESS>
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires the COMPILE_CONTRACTS env variable to be set, as the deployer needs the SDK to embed the proxy bytecode.
> In this step we are initiallizing the `OnChainProposer` contract with the `ALIGNED_PROOF_AGGREGATOR_SERVICE_ADDRESS` and skipping the rest of verifiers, you can find the address for the aligned aggegator service [here](https://docs.alignedlayer.com/guides/7_contract_addresses)
> Save the addresses of the deployed proxy contracts, as you will need them to run the L2 node.
> Accounts for the deployer, on-chain proposer owner, bridge owner, and proof sender must have funds. Add `--bridge-owner-pk <PRIVATE_KEY>` if you want the deployer to immediately call `acceptOwnership` on behalf of that owner; otherwise, they can accept later.

### 3. Deposit funds to the `AlignedBatcherPaymentService` contract from the proof sender

```bash
aligned deposit-to-batcher \
--network <NETWORK> \
--private_key <PROOF_SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY> \
--rpc_url <RPC_URL> \
--amount <DEPOSIT_AMOUNT>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the [Aligned CLI](https://docs.alignedlayer.com/guides/9_aligned_cli)

### 4. Running a node

In a console with `ethrex/crates/l2` as the current directory, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run --release --manifest-path ../../Cargo.toml --bin ethrex --features "l2,sp1" -- \
	l2 \
	--watcher.block-delay 0 \
	--network "../../fixtures/genesis/l2.json" \
	--l1.bridge-address <BRIDGE_ADDRESS> \
	--l1.on-chain-proposer-address <ON_CHAIN_PROPOSER_ADDRESS> \
	--eth.rpc-url <ETH_RPC_URL> \
	--aligned \
    --aligned-network <ALIGNED_NETWORK>  \
    --block-producer.coinbase-address <COINBASE_ADDRESS>  \
    --committer.l1-private-key <COMMITER_PRIVATE_KEY>  \
    --proof-coordinator.l1-private-key <PROOF_COORDINATOR_PRIVATE_KEY>  \
    --aligned.beacon-url <ALIGNED_BEACON_URL> \
	--datadir ethrex_l2 \
    --no-monitor
```

Both commiter and proof coordinator should have funds.

Aligned params explanation:

- `--aligned`: Enables aligned mode, enforcing all required parameters.
- `--aligned.beacon-url`: URL of the beacon client used by the Aligned SDK to verify proof aggregations, it has to support `/eth/v1/beacon/blobs`
- `--aligned-network`: Parameter used by the [Aligned SDK](https://docs.alignedlayer.com/guides/1.2_sdk_api_reference).

If you can't find a beacon client URL which supports that endpoint, you can run your own with lighthouse and ethrex:

Create secrets directory and jwt secret

```bash
mkdir -p ethereum/secrets/
cd ethereum/
openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" | tee ./secrets/jwt.hex
```

```bash
lighthouse bn --network <NETWORK> --execution-endpoint http://localhost:8551 --execution-jwt <PATH_TO_SECRET> --checkpoint-sync-url <CHECKPOINT_URL> --http --purge-db-force --supernode
```

```bash
cargo run --release --manifest-path ../../Cargo.toml --bin ethrex -- --authrpc.jwtsecret <PATH_TO_SECRET> --network <NETWORK>
```

### 4. Running the Prover

In a console with `ethrex/crates/l2` as the current directory, run the following command:

```bash
make init-prover-<sp1/risc0> GPU=true # The GPU parameter is optional
```

Then you should wait until aligned aggregates your proof

## How to run (local devnet)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes you have already generated the prover ELF/VK. See: [Generate the prover ELF/VK](#1-generate-the-prover-elfvk)

### Set Up the Aligned Environment

1. Clone the Aligned repository and checkout the currently supported release:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yetanotherco/aligned_layer.git
cd aligned_layer
git checkout tags/v0.19.1
```

2. Edit the `aligned_layer/network_params.rs` file to send some funds to the `committer` and `integration_test` addresses:

```
prefunded_accounts: '{
    "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
    "0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },

    ...
    "0xa0Ee7A142d267C1f36714E4a8F75612F20a79720": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
+   "0x4417092B70a3E5f10Dc504d0947DD256B965fc62": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
+   "0x3d1e15a1a55578f7c920884a9943b3b35d0d885b": { "balance": "100000000000000ETH" },
     }'
```

You can also decrease the seconds per slot in `aligned_layer/network_params.rs`:

```
# Number of seconds per slot on the Beacon chain
  seconds_per_slot: 4
```

Change `ethereum-genesis-generator` to 5.0.8

```
ethereum_genesis_generator_params:
  # The image to use for ethereum genesis generator
  image: ethpandaops/ethereum-genesis-generator:5.0.8
```

3. Make sure you have the latest version of [kurtosis](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/kurtosis) installed and start the ethereum-package:

```
cd aligned_layer
make ethereum_package_start
```

If you need to stop it run `make ethereum_package_rm`

4. Start the batcher:

First, increase the `max_proof_size` in `aligned_layer/config-files/config-batcher-ethereum-package.yaml` `max_proof_size: 104857600 # 100 MiB` for example.

```
cd aligned_layer
make batcher_start_ethereum_package
```

This is the Aligned component that receives the proofs before sending them in a batch.

> [!Warning]
> If you see the following error in the batcher: `[ERROR aligned_batcher] Unexpected error: Space limit exceeded: Message too long: 16940713 > 16777216` modify the file `aligned_layer/batcher/aligned-batcher/src/lib.rs` at line 433 with the following code:

```Rust
use tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::protocol::WebSocketConfig;

let mut stream_config = WebSocketConfig::default();
stream_config.max_frame_size = None;

let ws_stream_future =
    tokio_tungstenite::accept_async_with_config(raw_stream, Some(stream_config));
```

### Initialize L2 node
1. In another terminal let's deploy the L1 contracts, specifying the `AlignedProofAggregatorService` contract address, and adding the required prover types (Risc0 or SP1):
```
cd ethrex/crates/l2
COMPILE_CONTRACTS=true \
ETHREX_L2_ALIGNED=true \
ETHREX_DEPLOYER_ALIGNED_AGGREGATOR_ADDRESS=0xcbEAF3BDe82155F56486Fb5a1072cb8baAf547cc \
ETHREX_L2_SP1=true \
ETHREX_L2_RISC0=true \
make deploy-l1
```

Both `ETHREX_L2_SP1` and `ETHREX_L2_RISC0` are optional

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires the COMPILE_CONTRACTS env variable to be set, as the deployer needs the SDK to embed the proxy bytecode.

You will see that some deposits fail with the following error:

```
2025-10-13T19:44:51.600047Z ERROR ethrex::l2::deployer: Failed to deposit address=0x0002869e27c6faee08cca6b765a726e7a076ee0f value_to_deposit=0
2025-10-13T19:44:51.600114Z  WARN ethrex::l2::deployer: Failed to make deposits: Deployer EthClient error: eth_sendRawTransaction request error: insufficient funds for gas * price + value: have 0 want 249957710190063
```

This is because not all the accounts are pre-funded from the genesis.

2. Send some funds to the Aligned batcher payment service contract from the proof sender:

```
cd aligned_layer/crates/cli
cargo run deposit-to-batcher \
--network devnet \
--private_key 0x39725efee3fb28614de3bacaffe4cc4bd8c436257e2c8bb887c4b5c4be45e76d \
--amount 1ether
```

3. Start our l2 node:

```
cd ethrex/crates/l2
ETHREX_ALIGNED_MODE=true \
ETHREX_ALIGNED_BEACON_URL=http://127.0.0.1:58801 \
ETHREX_ALIGNED_NETWORK=devnet \
ETHREX_PROOF_COORDINATOR_DEV_MODE=false \
SP1=true \
RISC0=true \
make init-l2
```

Suggestion:
When running the integration test, consider increasing the `--committer.commit-time` to 2 minutes. This helps avoid having to aggregate the proofs twice. You can do this by adding the following flag to the `init-l2-no-metrics` target:

```
--committer.commit-time 120000
```

4. Start prover(s) in different terminals:
```bash
cd ethrex/crates/l2
make init-prover-<sp1/risc0> GPU=true # The GPU flag is optional
```

### Aggregate proofs:

After some time, you will see that the `l1_proof_verifier` is waiting for Aligned to aggregate the proofs. You can trigger an aggregation (for either sp1 or risc0 proofs) by running:

```bash
cd aligned_layer
make proof_aggregator_start AGGREGATOR=<sp1/risc0>

# or with gpu acceleration
make proof_aggregator_start_gpu AGGREGATOR=<sp1/risc0>
```

If successful, the `l1_proof_verifier` will print the following logs:

```
INFO ethrex_l2::sequencer::l1_proof_verifier: Proof for batch 1 aggregated by Aligned with commitment 0xa9a0da5a70098b00f97d96cee43867c7aa8f5812ca5388da7378454580af2fb7 and Merkle root 0xa9a0da5a70098b00f97d96cee43867c7aa8f5812ca5388da7378454580af2fb7
INFO ethrex_l2::sequencer::l1_proof_verifier: Batches verified in OnChainProposer, with transaction hash 0x731d27d81b2e0f1bfc0f124fb2dd3f1a67110b7b69473cacb6a61dea95e63321
```

## Behavioral Differences in Aligned Mode

### Prover

- Generates `Compressed` proofs instead of `Groth16`.
- Required because Aligned currently only accepts SP1 compressed proofs.

### Proof Sender

- Sends proofs to the **Aligned Batcher** instead of the `OnChainProposer` contract.
- Tracks the last proof sent using the rollup store.

![Proof Sender Aligned Mode](../img/aligned_mode_proof_sender.png)

### Proof Verifier

- Spawned only in Aligned mode.
- Monitors whether the next proof has been aggregated by Aligned.
- Once verified, collects all already aggregated proofs and triggers the advancement of the `OnChainProposer` contract by sending a single transaction.

![Aligned Mode Proof Verifier](../img/aligned_mode_proof_verifier.png)

### OnChainProposer

- Uses `verifyBatchesAligned()` instead of `verifyBatch()`.
- Receives an array of proofs to verify.
- Delegates proof verification to the `AlignedProofAggregatorService` contract.

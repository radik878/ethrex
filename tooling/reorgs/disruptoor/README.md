# Deep-reorg Kurtosis scenario

This directory contains the Kurtosis enclave config and assertoor task spec
for driving a deep reorg (>128 blocks) on a live EL+CL network and validating
that ethrex converges correctly.

## Known limitation: this harness does not reliably hit the deep-reorg path

The network-partition approach has proven flaky at actually exercising the
deep-reorg apply path, so it is `workflow_dispatch`-only and not the primary
test. The deterministic in-process simulator is (run from `tooling/reorgs`):

```sh
cargo run -- deep_reorg_beyond_128 /abs/path/target/release/ethrex
cargo run -- deep_reorg_side_chain_replay /abs/path/target/release/ethrex
```

Those drive `engine_newPayload` + `forkchoiceUpdated` directly and gate on the
node returning `VALID` at a head 150/200 blocks deep, so they reach the code
under test every run. Use this harness only for live-network sanity checks.

Why the partition harness is unreliable, observed end to end:

1. After disruptoor removes the partition wall, the two CLs had already scored
   each other as bad peers during the split and refuse to re-peer.
2. Restarting the CLs to force re-peering makes ethrex sync to the longer chain
   via full/snap sync instead of taking the FCU deep-reorg apply path.
3. ethrex was behind because on its isolated fork its slots were sparse, so it
   produced blocks slower and its chain ended up shorter than the peer's; on
   reconnect, sync-to-longer-chain wins over a reorg.

The orchestration only fires on the FCU `StateNotReachable` deep-reorg path; a
sync-to-longer-chain sidesteps it entirely. Making this harness deterministic
would require forcing the partitioned chains to equal length (or ethrex's fork
to be the longer one) and a CL that re-peers cleanly after a heal.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `network-partition-deep-reorg.yaml` | Kurtosis enclave manifest (4 EL/CL pairs + disruptoor) |
| `assertions.yaml` | Assertoor task spec: partition, wait 200 slots, heal, assert |

## Installing Kurtosis

Follow the official guide: <https://docs.kurtosis.com/install>

Short version (Debian/Ubuntu):

```sh
echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/kurtosis-tech/ /" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kurtosis.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kurtosis-cli
kurtosis engine start
```

## Running the partition scenario locally

1. Build the ethrex Docker image from the current branch:

   ```sh
   docker build -t ethrex:local .
   ```

2. Launch the enclave:

   ```sh
   kurtosis run --enclave deep-reorg \
     github.com/ethpandaops/ethereum-package \
     --args-file tooling/reorgs/disruptoor/network-partition-deep-reorg.yaml
   ```

3. Tear down when done:

   ```sh
   kurtosis enclave rm deep-reorg --force
   ```

## CI

See `.github/workflows/deep_reorg.yaml` for the GitHub Actions version.
It is triggered only by `workflow_dispatch` (never on PRs).

## Tuning

The YAML configs are starting points. After the first run produces real data
you may need to adjust:

- `validator_count` per participant (affects finalization speed)
- `seconds_per_slot` (12 s is mainnet; lower for faster iteration locally)
- Partition duration (`minSlotDelta: 200` in `assertions.yaml`)
- Service names passed to disruptoor (inspect with `kurtosis service ls deep-reorg`)

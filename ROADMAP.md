# Short– to Mid-Term Roadmap

This document represents the **short- to mid-term roadmap**.
Items listed here are actionable, concrete, and intended to be worked on in the coming weeks.
Long-term research directions and second-order ideas are intentionally out of scope.

**Priority reflects relative urgency, not effort.**

This is a WIP document and it requires better descriptions; it's supposed to be used internally.

## Execution

| Item | Issue | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Replace BTreeMap with FxHashMap | #5757 | 0 | Discarded (small regression) | Replace BTreeMap/BTreeSet with FxHashMap/FxHashSet|
| Use FxHashset for access lists | #5800 | 0 | Done (8% improvement) | Replace HashSet with FxHashset |
| Skip Zero-Initialization in Memory Resize | #5755 | 0 | Measure #5774 | Use unsafe set_len (EVM spec says expanded memory is zero) |
| Remove RefCell from Memory  | #5756 | 0 | Measure #5793 | Consider using UnsafeCell with manual safety guarantees, or restructure to avoid shared ownership. |
| Try out PEVM | | 0 | Done. Simple integration caused regression. | Benchmark again against pevm |
| Inline Hot Opcodes | #5752 | 0 | Done. 0 to 20% speedup depending on the time. | Opcodes call a function in a jump table when some of the most used ones could perform better being inlined instead |
| Test ECPairing libraries | #5758 | 0 | Done (#5792). Used Arkworks. 2x speedup on those specific operations. | Benchmark arkworks pairing in levm|
| PGO/BOLT | #5759 | 0 | In progress (#5775) | Try out both [PGO](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rustc/profile-guided-optimization.html) and [BOLT](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/bolt) to see if we can improve perf |
| Use an arena allocator for substate tracking | #5754 | 0 | Discarded (#5791). Regression of 10% in mainnet. | Substates are currently a linked list allocated through boxing. Consider using an arena allocator (e.g. bumpalo) for them |
| ruint  | #5760 | 0 | Discarded simple approach. Regression. | Try out [ruint](https://github.com/recmo/uint) as the `U256` library to see if it improves performance. Part of SIMD initiative |
| Nibbles | #5801 | 1 | Measure #5912 and #5932 | Nibbles are currently stored as a byte (`u8`), when they could be stored compactly as actual nibbles in memory and reduce by half their representation size. Also we may stack-allocate their buffers instead of heap-allocated vecs. |
| RLP Duplication | #5949 | 1 | Pending | Check whether we are encoding/decoding something twice (clearly unnecessary) |
| Object pooling | #5934 | 2 | Pending | Reuse EVM stack frames to reduce allocations and improve performance |
| Avoid clones in hot path | #5753 | 2 | Measure #5809 on mainnet | Avoid Clone on Account Load and check rest of the hot path |
| SIMD Everywhere | | 2 | Pending | There are some libraries that can be replaced by others that use SIMD instructions for better performance |
| EXTCODESIZE without full bytecode | | 1 | Done (#6034). Improvement of 25%. | EXTCODESIZE loads entire bytecode just to get length. Add `get_account_code_size()` or store code length alongside code (`crates/vm/levm/src/opcode_handlers/environment.rs:260-274`) |
| TransactionQueue data structure | | 1 | Discarded. It is not significant within the critical path. | `TransactionQueue` uses `Vec` with `remove(0)` which is O(n). Replace with `BinaryHeap`/`BTreeSet` or `VecDeque` for O(log n) or O(1) operations (`crates/blockchain/payload.rs:708-820`) |

## IO

| Item | Issue | Priority | Status | Description |
|------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Add Block Cache (RocksDB) | #5935 | 0 | Discarded. Did not improve (#6195). | Currently there is no explicit block cache, relying on OS page cache. Also try row cache |
| Use Two-Level Index (RocksDB) | #5936 | 0 | Discarded. Performance regressed by two orders of magnitude on both throughput and latency (#6196). | Use Two-Level Index with Partitioned Filters |
| Enable unordered writes for State (RocksDB) | #5937 | 0 | Pending | For `ACCOUNT_TRIE_NODES, STORAGE_TRIE_NODES cf_opts.set_unordered_write(true);` Faster writes when we don't need strict ordering|
| Increase Bloom Filter (RocksDB) | #5938 | 0 | Pending | Change and benchmark higher bits per key for state tables |
| Consider LZ4 for State Tables (RocksDB) | #5939 | 0 | Pending | Trades CPU for smaller DB and potentially better cache utilization |
| Page caching + readahead | #5940 | 0 | Pending | Use for trie iteration, sync operations |
| Optimize for Point Lookups (RocksDB) | #5941 | 0 | Pending | Adds hash index inside FlatKeyValue for faster point lookups |
| Modify block size (RocksDB) | #5942 | 0 | Pending | Benchmark different block size configurations |
| Memory-Mapped Reads (RocksDB) | #5943 | 0 | Pending | Can be an improvement on high-RAM systems |
| Increase layers commit threshold | #5944 | 0 | Pending | For read-heavy workloads with plenty of RAM |
| Remove locks | #5945 | 1 | Pending | Check if there are still some unnecessary locks, e.g. in the VM we have one |
| Benchmark bloom filter | #5946 | 1 | Pending | Review trie layer's bloom filter, remove it or test other libraries/configurations |
| Use multiget on trie traversal | #4949 | 1 | Pending | Using multiget on trie traversal might reduce read time |
| Bulk reads for block bodies | | 1 | Pending | Implement `multi_get` for `get_block_bodies` and `get_block_bodies_by_hash` which currently loop over per-key reads (`crates/storage/store.rs:388-454`) |
| Canonical tx index | | 1 | Pending | Transaction location lookup does O(k) prefix scans. Add a canonical-tx index table or DUPSORT layout for O(1) lookups (`crates/storage/store.rs:562-606`) |
| Reduce trie cache Mutex contention | | 1 | Pending | `trie_cache` is behind `Arc<Mutex<Arc<TrieLayerCache>>>`. Use `ArcSwap` or `RwLock` for lock-free reads (`crates/storage/store.rs:159,1360`) |
| Reduce LatestBlockHeaderCache contention | | 1 | Pending | `LatestBlockHeaderCache` uses Mutex for every read. Use `ArcSwap` for atomic pointer swaps (`crates/storage/store.rs:2880-2894`) |
| Use Bytes/Arc in trie layer cache | | 2 | Pending | Trie layer cache clones `Vec<u8>` values on every read. Use `Bytes` or `Arc<[u8]>` to reduce allocations (`crates/storage/layering.rs:57,63`) |
| Split hot vs cold data | | 2 | Pending | Geth "freezer/ancients" pattern: store recent state in fast KV store, push old bodies/receipts to append-only ancient store to reduce compaction pressure |
| Configurable cache budgets | | 2 | Pending | Expose cache split for DB/trie/snapshot as runtime config. Currently hardcoded in ethrex |
| Toggle compaction during sync | | 2 | Pending | Disable RocksDB compaction during snap sync for higher write throughput, then compact after (Nethermind pattern). Wire `disable_compaction/enable_compaction` into sync stages |
| Spawned | #5947 | 3 | Pending | [*Spawnify*](https://github.com/lambdaclass/spawned) io intensive components/flows. Mempool and Snapsync are top priorities |
